When it comes to downloading the images in the document, we talked about two possible ways of doing it.
One was to store all the URL's in a database table, with a reference to the document. When downloading all documents, one would go through the database table and find all URL's with reference to one of the downloaded documents.
The other is to store the URL's in the document, and then loop through every document finding every URL.
Either way, we would download the images and store them in a local folder.

We've chosen to keep the URL's in the document.
